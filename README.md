CommandRouter
==============

A simple tool help you convert textual command to method call for Java/Android.

## Quick start
if you want to parse a textual command like this:
```
"cmd://trial/show?msg=helloworld&repeat=3 
```
in order to execute the follow code:
```
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
   System.out.println("helloworld")
}
```
You don't need to write any code to parse text and do the conditional. Use annotations of CommandRouter to define a handler:
```
@HandlerAlias("trial")
public class TestHandler extends CommandHandler {

    @CommandAlias("show")
    public void showText(Object context,
                         @ParamAlias("msg") String text,
                         @ParamAlias("repeat") int repeatTimes) {
        for (int i = 0; i < repeatTimes; i++) {
            System.out.println("helloworld")
        }
    }
}
```
and just 'execute' the command by CommandRouter:
```
router.invokeCommand(this, "cmd://trial/show?msg=helloworld&repeat=3");
```
Enjoy the clean code!

## Usage

**STEP 1: create CommandHandler and command methods**

Create subclass of ```CommandHandler```. A *Command Handler* is a group of command method. Each command method is invoke by one command.

Use these three important annotations to decorate your class:

 - **```HandlerAlias```**ï¼šdefine a handler's name.
 - **```CommandAlias```**: define a command's name. A command method can has mutli alias name.
 - **```ParamAlias```**: define a param of the command. There is 2 optional field:
  - ```defaultRaw```: the textual value before unmashell.
  - ```converter```: the converter class to handler this type of param.
     
```
@HandlerAlias("trial")
public class TestHandler extends CommandHandler {

    @CommandAlias("show")
    public void showText(Object context,
                         @ParamAlias("msg") String text,
                         @ParamAlias(value="repeat", defaultRaw="5") int repeatTimes) {
        // some code ...
    }
}
```

> Notice: the first param of a command method must be the context Object. It is not one of the command params.

**STEP 2: build instance of CommandRouter**

Before build the ```CommandRouter```, you should determine the command format and chose the right ```CommandDriver```. The follow command format is build-in supported:

driver class       | format           | command sample
-------------------|------------------|---------------
UriDriver          | Hierarchical URI | ```cmd://trial/show?msg=helloworld``` (use host part as handler name and path part as command name)
JsonDriver*        | Json             | ```{handler:"trial", command:"show",param:{msg:"hello"}}```
CommandLineDriver* | shell-style      | ```trial show --msg helloworld```

Recommend to use ```CommandRouterBuilder``` to build router instance:
```
CommandRouter router = new CommandRouterBuilder()
                .setDriver(new UriDriver())
                .addCommandHandler(TestHandler.class)
                .addGeneralValueConverters()
                .build();
```

**STEP 3: execute the command**

Execute the textual command by CommandRouter where you need it. Your context object will pass to the command method.
```
router.invokeCommand(context, "cmd://trial/show?msg=helloworld&repeat=3");
```

**Using in android**

Ensure that this line is added to your proguard config:
```
-keepattributes *Annotation*
```
